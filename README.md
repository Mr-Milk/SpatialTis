# SpatialTis
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spatialtis/badge/?version=latest)](https://spatialtis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) ![CI](https://github.com/Mr-Milk/SpatialTis/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Mr-Milk/SpatialTis/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=DYNZ45IPSQ) 

SpatialTis is a spatial analysis toolkit for single-cell multiplexed tissue data using [`AnnData`](https://icb-anndata.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/#) object as input. Multiprocessing is supported for most analysis functions.

> **Note**: This package is still in development, API may change in the future.



SpatialTis contains following modules:

- **Preprocessing**
- **Data statistic**
    - Cell components
    - Cell density
    - Cell morphology
    - Cell co-occurrence
- **Find cell neighbors**
- **Spatial analysis**
    - Spatial distribution
    - Spatial heterogeneity
    - Hotspot detection
    - Neighborhood analysis
    - Spatial community detection
    - Marker influence by neighbor cell/marker
